# INFO 523 Homework 3

Repository for HW 03 from the course: INFO 523 - Data Mining and Discovery taught by Dr. Greg Chism

## Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository to:
   
   #### If Using R:
   - An RStudio Project (If using R)
   - A Project within [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)

   #### If Using Python: 
   - A VSCode directory
   - A Google Collab project
   
### 2. View the R/Python Exercise 3 content:
   If Using R: found [here](https://datamineaz.org/slides/week6/rexercise3) and [here](https://datamineaz.org/slides/week6/rexercise3_1) 
   If Using Python: found [here](https://datamineaz.org/python/classificationpython) 
   
### 3. Reproduce the exercise in a new Quarto Document or Jupyter Notebook with a novel dataset from the [tidytuesday repository 2023 datasets](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023)
  - Hint: Quarto can render a document into a Jupyter Notebook. I recommend just using Quarto unless you're using Google Collab. See tutorial documentation on available formats [here]([https://posit.cloud/](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html)https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html).

#### Suggested datasets & question:
Can we predict the presence or absence of a specific bird species based on habitat type, surrounding environment (like presence of squirrels, cats, humans, etc.), and feeding habits in a given location?
- [**Bird FeederWatch data**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-10)

Can we predict whether a particular artist is included in Janson's History of Art or Gardner's Art Through the Ages based on the artist's nationality, gender, race, ethnicity, and their exhibition counts at prominent museums (MoMA and The Whitney) by a specific publication year?
- [**Art history data**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-17)

Can we predict which season of 'The Joy of Painting' a particular painting was featured in based on the unique colors used in the painting and the total number of unique colors?
- [**Bob Ross Paintings**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-02-21)

Can we predict a country's primary reliance on renewable energy (categorized as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low') based on its yearly GDP, population, and the breakdown of energy sources (e.g., share of energy from wind, solar, nuclear, coal, etc.) for a particular year?
- [**Energy Production**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-06)

Can we predict the 'founder crop' category of a plant based on its taxonomic details, site location, phase, and edibility?
- [**Neolithic founder crops**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-04-18)

Based on a county's demographic, employment, and household data, can we predict whether the median price for center-based childcare for preschoolers (mc_preschool) will be above or below the state's average?
- [**Childcare costs**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-09)

Based on the frequency of certain keywords and symbols in an email, can we classify the email as 'spam' or 'not spam'?
- [**Spam E-mail**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-08-15)
